''' TODO
> Given two strings S and B find all permutations of S within B

Notes:
- What is a permutation?
- Come up with a good example (large & generic) then figure out the output.
- "Reverse Engineer" your intuitive thought process.
- Pay attention to any short circuiting or tricks you use.

Example:
S = abbc
B = babcabcbebbacbabab
