<summary>Branch N Bound definitions</summary>

1. Is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatoric optimisation problems, as well as mathematical optimisation. A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions. That is, the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent the subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution and is discared if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm.

<summary>How does it work?</summary>

- Branch n bound builds the state space tree and finds the optimal solution quickly by pruning a few of the tree branches which doesn't satisfy the bound.
