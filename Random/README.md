| :----: | :----: | :----: |
|[Two Sum](./twoSum/README.md)|Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.|Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9, Output: [0,1]|
|[Rome Zeros From Array](./romeZerosFromArray/README.md)|Algorithm that brings all nonzero elements to the left of the array, and returns the number of nonzero elements.|Input: [1,0,2,0,0,3,4], Output: ([4,1,3,2,0,0,0], Nonzero elements: 4)|
|[Look and Say](./lookAndSay/README.md)|Generate a sequence with the following rule: To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.|Input: 1211, Output: 111221|
|[Largest Subarray Sum](./largestSubArraySum/README.md)|There's an array of integers, I need to find the largest sum across all contiguous subarrays.|Input: [-1,-1,3,2,-5,1], Output: 5, subarray indices [2,3]|
|[Ones Minus Zeros Matrix](./onesMinusZeros/README.md)|You are given a m x n binary matrix grid, add the number of 1s from row[i] & col[j], then substract the number of 0s from row[i] & col[j]|Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]], Output: [[0,0,4],[0,0,4],[-2,-2,2]]|
|[Maximum Connected Subgraph of 1s](./maximalMexicanMates/README.md)|Find the size of the largest connected subgraph.|Input: [[1 0 1],[1 1 1],[1 0 0]], Output: 6|
|[Island Perimeter](./islandPerimeter/README.md)|Find the perimeter of a subconnected graph of 1s|Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]], Output: 16|
|[Flood Fill](./floodFill/README.md)|To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.|Input: [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2, Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]|
