Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand how RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them.

Gregor's favorite prime number is 𝑃. Gregor wants to find two bases of 𝑃. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers 𝑎 and 𝑏 which satisfy both of the following properties.

𝑃mod𝑎=𝑃mod𝑏
, where 𝑥mod𝑦
 denotes the remainder when 𝑥
 is divided by 𝑦
, and
2≤𝑎<𝑏≤𝑃
.
